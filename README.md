# Exploratory Data Analysis

This course is designed to serve students of the Vanderbilt Data Science Program.

## Overview

This course will teach students how to explore, summarize, and graph data (big and small). Learning topics are broken into three parts over 16 weeks, they include: principles of perception, how to display data, scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, bar charts, proper data summaries, dimensionality reduction, multidimensional scaling, and unsupervised clustering algorithms, such as principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and nearest neighbor algorithms. The course will utilize a variety of data types including text data, network data, survey data and many others.
